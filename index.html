<p>If your question isn't listed here, please post a comment at the <a>WordPress.org support forum</a>. I monitor the forums on an ongoing basis. If you're looking for more advanced paid support, please see <a href="http://ajaydsouza.com/support/">details here</a>.</p>

<p>= Can I customize the output? =   </p>

<p>All options can be customized within the Options page in WP-Admin itself</p>

<p>The plugin also supports the use of template files within your theme. You can create a file called <code>better-search-template.php</code> in your theme's directory and the plugin will use it to display the results.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="http://ajaydsouza.com/wordpress/plugins/better-search/bsearch-templates">http://ajaydsouza.com/wordpress/plugins/better-search/bsearch-templates</a> for use of custom templates and template tags supported by Better Search
Additionally, I have included a simple template for WordPress Twenty Eleven theme that you can simply drop into the <code>twentyeleven</code> folder</p>

<p>= Can you create a search template for my theme? =</p>

<p>Yes I can. However, there are no guarantee on the time frame for the same. Additionally, if I am unable to access the theme for testing, e.g. with paid premium themes, I won't be able to create this template.</p>

<p>If you have already created a template that you would like to share with the WordPress Community, you can <a href="http://ajaydsouza.com/contact/">contact me</a> and I will add it into the package.</p>
